We use [Localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) as a stub implementation of many AWS services that we can run locally for development and testing of Taco.

```

$ awslocal s3api create-bucket --bucket taco-deposited-files
```

#### Create the Kinesis stream:

$ awslocal kinesis create-stream --stream-name deposit --shard-count 3
```
