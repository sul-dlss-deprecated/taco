# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: What is the status of this project? What are the goals?

**A:**  The TACO project is a _prototype_ that will allow us to test the viability of some new (to SUL) technologies and patterns that we want to consider for use in the SDR3 redesign.  TACO is not production code and is not supported in any way.

## Q: Why didn't you use Open API Spec 3.0 (F.K.A.: Swagger)

**A:** We really like the go-swagger library, and it doesn't yet support Swagger 3.0.  We would like to use swagger 3.0 someday, particularly for file uploads (without form-multipart), but we've determined that to be out of scope for the prototype.
