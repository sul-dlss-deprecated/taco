## Development practices
Some agreements laid out by the development team are listed in the [Development Practices](./docs/Development_Practices.md) document.

## Go Local Development Setup

1. Install go (grab binary from here or use `brew install go` on Mac OSX).
2. Setup your Go workspace (where your Go code, binaries, etc. are kept together. See some helpful documentation here on the Go concept of workspaces: https://github.com/alco/gostart#1-go-tool-is-only-compatible-with-code-that-resides-in-a-workspace.):
      ```bash
      $ mkdir -p ~/go
      $ export GOPATH=~/go
      $ export PATH=~/go/bin:$PATH
      $ cd ~/go
      ```
      Your Go code repositories will reside within `~/go/src/...` in the `$GOPATH`. Name these paths to avoid library clash, for example TACO Go code could be in `~/go/src/github.com/sul-dlss-labs/taco`. This should be where your Github repository resides too.
3. In order to download the project code to `~/go/src/github.com/sul-dlss-labs/taco`, from any directory in your ``$GOPATH`, run:
    ```bash
    $ go get github.com/sul-dlss-labs/taco
    ```
4. Handle Go project dependencies with the Go `dep` package:
    * Install Go Dep via `brew install dep` then `brew upgrade dep` (if on Mac OSX).
    * If your project's `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock` have not yet been populated, you need to add an inferred list of your dependencies by running `dep init`.
    * If your project has those file populated, then make sure your dependencies are synced via running `dep ensure`.
    * If you need to add a new dependency, run `dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/errors`. This should add the dependency and put the new dependency in your `Gopkg.*` files.

5. [Set up Localstack to Fake AWS Services Locally](docs/localstack.md)

6. Setup Configuration Variables
    * Configuration variables for development default to point at [Localstack](docs/localstack.md) services.  You can override the default configuration by using environment variables. See the list of the environment variables in [config](config/config.go)
    * If you want to report failures to HoneyBadger set `HONEYBADGER_API_KEY=aaaaaaaa`

## Running the Go Code locally without a build

```shell
$ TACO_SECRET_KEY=s00perSekret AWS_REGION=localstack AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=999999 AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=1231 go run main.go
```

Note: we explain the AWS keys usage below.

## Building the TACO Binary

### Building just the TACO Docker container
Start external services using [Localstack](docs/localstack.md) then run:
```shell
$ docker build -t taco .
$ docker run -e TACO_SECRET_KEY=s00perSekret -e AWS_REGION=localstack -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=999999 -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=1231 -p 8080:8080 taco
```

### Build for the local OS
This will create a binary in your path that you can then run the application with.

```shell
$ go build -o tacod main.go
$ ./tacod
```

## Running the TACO Binary

Now start the API server (passing in API keys; these can be fake and are only required for localstack):
```shell
$ TACO_SECRET_KEY=s00perSekret AWS_REGION=localstack AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=999999 AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=1231 ./tacod
```
See [Tokens](docs/tokens.md) for information about generating a user token.

Then you can interact with it using `curl`:
```shell
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "Authorization: bearer <token>" \
 -d@examples/request.json http://localhost:8080/v1/resource
```

it will return a response like:
```json
{"id":"fe1f66a9-5285-4b28-8240-0482c8fff6c7"}
```

Then you can use the returned identifier to retrieve the original:

```shell
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "Authorization: bearer <token>" \
 http://localhost:8080/v1/resource/fe1f66a9-5285-4b28-8240-0482c8fff6c7
```

You can then update the resource with a **PATCH** request:

Note: in the example file, the `externalIdentifier` and `identification.identifier` must be set to the value returned from the POST, and
the `tacoIdentifier` must be set to the value retrieved in the GET

Without changing the version number:

```shell
$ curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d@examples/update_request.json \
-H "Authorization: bearer <token>" \
http://localhost:8080/v1/resource/fe1f66a9-5285-4b28-8240-0482c8fff6c7
```

With changing the version number:
```shell
$ curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d@examples/update_request_new_version.json \
-H "Authorization: bearer <token>" \
http://localhost:8080/v1/resource/fe1f66a9-5285-4b28-8240-0482c8fff6c7
```

Now, we're going to get a file we can use to test the uploader:
```shell
$ curl -Lo test.pdf \
 https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/raw/master/spec/fixtures/hyrax/hyrax_test4.pdf
```

Than you can upload that file into TACO by doing:

```shell
$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer <token>" \
-F "upload=@test.pdf;type=application/pdf" http://localhost:8080/v1/file
```

## Running TACO via docker compose
Use the following steps to build and run taco with its dependencies. The TACO service will be available at `http://\[::\]:8080`
```shell
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose run resources
$ docker-compose run taco
```

To run the integration and end to end tests on the containers run:
```shell
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose run resources
$ docker-compose run tester
```

Docker Compose can also be used to spin up just the localstack services and taco in separate terminal windows to be used together. To do so, open a tab in your terminal and run:
```shell
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose run resources
$ docker-compose run localstack
```
Then, in a separate window, start the TACO container. The TACO service will be available at `http://\[::\]:8080`
```shell
$ docker-compose run taco
```
Logs for any service can be tail'd or followed using the `docker-compose logs` command:
```shell
$ docker-compose logs -f taco
```

To stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes created by `docker-compose up` run:
```shell
$ docker-compose down
```

## Testing

Testing and test driven development is outlined in the [Testing Guidelines & Framework](./docs/testing.md) documentation.

## API Code Structure

We use `go-swagger` to generate the API code within the `generated/` directory.

We connect the specification-generated API code to our own handlers defined with `handlers/`. Handlers are where we add our own logic for processing requests.

Our handlers and the generated API code is connected within `main.go`, which is the file to start the API.

### Install Go-Swagger

The API code is generated from `swagger.yml` using `go-swagger` library. As this is not used in the existing codebase anywhere currently, you'll need to install the `go-swagger` library before running these commands (commands for those using Mac OSX):

```shell
$ brew tap go-swagger/go-swagger
$ brew install go-swagger
$ brew upgrade go-swagger
```

This should give you the `swagger` binary command in your $GOPATH and allow you to manage versions better (TBD write this up). The version of your go-swagger binary is **0.13.0** (run `swagger version` to check this).

### Nota Bene on go-swagger install from source

If instead of brew, you decide to install go-swagger from source (i.e. `go get -u github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger`), you will be running the library at its Github `dev` branch. You will need to change into that library (`cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger`) and checkout from Github the latest release (`git checkout tags/0.13.0`). Then you will need to run `go install github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger` to generate the go-swagger binary in your `$GOPATH/bin`.

### To generate the API code

There appears to be no best way to handle specification-based re-generation of the `generated/` API code, so the following steps are recommended:

```shell
$ git rm -rf generated/
$ mkdir generated
$ swagger generate server -t generated --exclude-main --principal authorization.Agent
```

### To generate the validator and default values```
```shell
go generate
```
This will serialize all the json in the `maps/` directory into `validators/maps.go`

Additionally it grabs the defaults from `maps/DepositFile.json` and
creates a template for File resources in `handlers/file_template.go`.

### Non-generated code

Anything outside of `generated/` is our own code and should not be touched by a regeneration of the API code from the Swagger specification.

## SWAGGER Generated Documentation

To see the SWAGGER generated documentation, go to https://sul-dlss-labs.github.io/taco/. This is automatically generated off of the Swagger spec in this repository on the `master` branch.

If you want to generate this documentation locally, you can run the following:

```shell
$ swagger serve swagger.yml
```

This should prompt you to your web browser for the HTML generated docs.
